# Bootcamp-SQL
For this project, I will be using a simple SQL script to populate a database with the famous Northwind example, adapted for PostgreSQL. This script will set up the Northwind database on PostgreSQL, creating all the necessary tables and inserting sample data so that I can start working immediately with SQL queries and analysis in a practical context. This example database is an excellent tool for learning and practicing SQL operations and techniques, particularly useful for understanding how to manipulate relational data in a realistic environment.
